description = "<p>在儀徵與揚州交界的田野。有一些在路上，有一些下到田裏面，距離聲源大槩 2 米。辳邨眞是太安靜了，一點嘈雜的聲音都沒有。遠處有鐵路橋，不時有火車開過，有些想去錄。九點還有寺廟的鐘聲，但很遠，不知從哪發出來的，下次去的時候一定要找到。</p><p>分爲四段：1、蟲鳴，2、加入了高頻的蟲鳴，3、蛙聲逐漸起來，達到高潮，4、單獨的蛙聲</p><p>gear: Mixpre 3, a pair of SE 8. Location: a field in the border of Yizheng and Yangzhou. Some were on the road, some were down to the field, and the sound source is about 2 meters away. The countryside was too quiet, there was no any noise. There were railway bridges in the distance. From time to time, there were trains passing by, and I want to record, a little. There were temple bells at nine o'clock, but very far away.</p><p>It's divided into four segments: 1, insects, 2, added high-frequency insects, 3, frog sound gradually reaching a climax, 4, separate frog sound</p>"
