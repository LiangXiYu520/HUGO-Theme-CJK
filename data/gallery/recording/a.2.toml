description = "<p>臺北跨年夜的熱鬧。這次比臺南的那箇滿意一些，素材收集得多了，用起來順手一點。一共翦了 4 箇小時。用了三處混音，把環境聲和要突出的聲音分開來錄，效果的確好一些。</p><p>The fun of Taipei’s New Year’s Eve. This is more satisfactory than *Tainan*, as the material was collected much more. I spent a total of 4 hours. I recorded the sound to be highlighted and the ambience separately, and used three remixes. The effect is definitely better. See [2018 2018](/blog/2018/01/01/xbnm.html) for details.</p>"
