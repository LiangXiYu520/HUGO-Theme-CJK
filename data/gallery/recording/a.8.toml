description = "<p>某日午睡醒了之後發現嘴皮能發出奇怪的口哨聲，就用手機錄下來了。有一箇頻率很高的片段，看了下頻譜，基頻是 3—4 kHz，絕了。手機錄的，原始格式是 22khz，音質很渣。</p><p>gear: Mixpre 3, a pair of SE 8. When I woke up one afternoon, I found that my mouth could make a strange whistle, and I recorded it on my mobile phone. There is a very high frequency segment. The spectrum shows the fundamental frequency is 3-4 kHz. The original format of the mobile phone is 22kHz, and the sound quality is terrible.</p>"
