## A

Utah is in the western United States. It is the 13th-largest states by area, and with a population over three million. 

Utah was Mexican territory when the first pioneers arrived in 1847. Following the death of Joseph Smith in 1844, Brigham Young, as president of the Quorum of the Twelve, became the effective leader of the LDS Church in Illinois. To address the growing conflicts between his people and their neighbors, Young agreed with Illinois Governor Thomas Ford in October 1845 that the Mormons would leave by the following year. Young and the first band of Mormon pioneers reached the Salt Lake Valley on July 24, 1847. Over the next 22 years, more than 70,000 pioneers crossed the plains and settled in Utah.For the first few years, Brigham Young and the thousands of early settlers of Salt Lake City struggled to survive. The arid desert land was deemed by the Mormons as desirable as a place where they could practice their religion without harassment.

Utah is known for its natural diversity and is home to features ranging from arid deserts to pine forests in valleys. It is a rugged and geographically diverse state at the convergence of three geological regions: the Rocky Mountains, the Great Basin, and the Colorado Plateau.

Utah features a dry, semi-arid to desert climate, although its many mountains feature a large variety of climates, with the highest points in the Uinta Mountains. The dry weather is a result of the state's location in the rain shadow of the Sierra Nevada in California. The eastern half of the state lies in the rain shadow of the Wasatch Mountains. The primary source of precipitation for the state is the Pacific Ocean, with the state usually lying in the path of large Pacific storms from October to May. Utah's temperatures are extreme, with cold temperatures in winter due to its elevation, and very hot summers statewide. 

The state has a highly diversified economy, with major sectors including transportation, education, information technology, and mining and a major tourist destination for outdoor recreation. Utah also has the 14th-highest median average income and the least income inequality of any U.S. state.

Beginning in the early 20th century, with the establishment of such national parks (Arches, Bryce Canyon, Canyonlands, Capitol Reef, and Zion), Utah became known for its natural beauty. Southern Utah became a popular filming spot for arid, rugged scenes featured in the popular mid-century western film genre. From such films, most US residents recognize such natural landmarks as Delicate Arch and "the Mittens" of Monument Valley. During the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, with the construction of the Interstate highway system, accessibility to the southern scenic areas was made easier. Since the establishment of Alta Ski Area in 1939 and the subsequent development of several ski resorts in the state's mountains, Utah's skiing has become world-renowned.

During the late 20th century, the state grew quickly. In the 1970s growth was phenomenal in the suburbs of the Wasatch Front. Sandy was one of the fastest-growing cities in the country at that time. Today, many areas of Utah continue to see boom-time growth. Management of transportation and urbanization are major issues in politics, as development consumes agricultural land and wilderness areas, and transportation is a major reason for poor air quality in Utah.

Urban development in Utah is mostly concentrated in two areas: the Wasatch Front in the north-central part of the state, which is home to two-thirds of the population, and Washington County in the south, with more than 170,000 residents.

Utah ranks among the highest in total fertility rate, 47th in teenage pregnancy, lowest in percentage of births out of wedlock, and lowest in percentage of teen pregnancies terminated in abortion.

Here are some stunning landscapes you’ll only see in Utah.

### Wasatch Mountains

The Wasatch Range, which runs north-south from the border with Idaho down into the center of the state, can be considered “Utah’s mountains” — a full 85% of the state’s residents live within 15 miles of these peaks. They grace the eastern skylines of Salt Lake City and the other major population centers of the Salt Lake Valley.

### Canyonlands National Park

This national park covers a tremendous expanse of southeast Utah, a short drive from Moab, and protects the canyons of the mighty Colorado and Green Rivers both above and below their confluence. Many visitors to Canyonlands come specifically for the rivers — Cataract Canyon, just downstream from the Confluence, is one of America’s premier whitewater destinations.

### Monument Valley

Monument Valley straddles the Utah-Arizona border near the Four Corners. You’ll get the best views by driving south on Highway 163 in Utah. The sandstone buttes, which rise as tall as 1,000 feet, are typically only observed from the road, but there are plenty of options for getting closer.

### Bryce Canyon National Park

Full of hoodoos naturally carved from red-white-striped rock, ringed by forests of spruce and pine, with some of the darkest night skies in America — this is Bryce Canyon. Get a feel for the park via the 13-viewpoint scenic drive, and then dig into a day hike on the Rim Trail, Navajo Loop, or Tower Bridge routes. Longer backcountry treks are also possible. In winter, the cover of snow changes everything, and you can see it all from a fresh perspective on snowshoes or cross-country skis.

### Zion National Park

In the southwest corner of the state, the North Fork of the Virgin River plunges through 15 miles of one of the most gorgeous canyons in the world. Zion National Park is centered on this namesake canyon, while also spilling out to cover miles of the desert landscape that surrounds it. From climbing the precipitous ridge of Angels Landing, to canyoneering in the Narrows, to heading out into lesser-explored backcountry for a multi-night trek, Zion holds some of the most rewarding adventures in all of Utah.

### Great Salt Lake

may be one of the features that Utah is best known for. Its surface area belies its depth — an average of just 16 feet. A great way to view the lake is from the beaches and gentle hills of Antelope Island, a state park in the southeast corner of the lake that’s a quick drive from downtown SLC. Hiking, biking, and equestrian trails crisscross the island, sharing space with herds of free-ranging bison, bighorn sheep, and antelope. Or give yourself a few hours and you can get a more elevated view — at 6,596 feet, Frary Peak is the highest point along the island’s mountainous spine.

### High Uintas Wilderness

The northeastern corner of Utah is dominated by the Uinta Mountains, which run from east to west and intersect the Wasatch Range. The High Uintas Wilderness spans much of the range, encompassing numerous mountain lakes and streams as well as the tallest peaks. Access is via the Mirror Lake Scenic Byway (State Route 150) out of Kamas, which is just east of Park City. This road offers plenty of opportunities for picnicking, camping, and roadside photography.

### Capitol Reef National Park

A 100-mile-long, skinny strip of land, Capitol Reef National Park runs from the Cathedral Valley area. The small town of Torrey, situated on Highway 24, is your gateway, from where you can easily get to the park visitor center and miles of little-traveled hiking trails. Grab an overnight camping permit and it’s just you and Utah under the stars.
