Lincoln was, as his friend and admirer, David Davis, once said, ‘‘the most reticent—Secretive man I Ever Saw—or Expect to See.’’ His law partner of fourteen years, William Henry Herndon, agreed: ‘‘the man was hard, very difficult to understand, even by his bosom friends and his close and intimate neighbors among whom he associated.’’

wrote Whitney, ‘‘If a witness told the truth without evasion Lincoln was respectful and patronizing to him, but he would score a perjured witness unmercifully. He took no notes, but remembered everything quite as well as those who did so.’’

overspill

Lincoln’s intellectual curiosity frequently overspilled even the professional requirements of lawyering. John Todd Stuart told a campaign biographer in 1860 that Lincoln had a ‘‘mind of a metaphysical and philosophical order—His knowledge of the languages is limited but in other respects I consider a man of very general and varied knowledge.’’

Of all the hopeful liberal experiments, only one large-scale example survived, and that was the United States. And, by the 1850s, it was becoming increasingly plain that even the United States contained within itself the seeds of illiberal self-destruction in the form of an aggressive and arrogant ‘‘Slave Power,’’ which sought to fasten the legalization of human slavery to the rapid westward expansion of the American republic.

forebears

The Lincolns had been a family of middling gentry in Norfolk, a county whose flat fenlands were a hotbed of Puritan religious dissent from the Church of England.

But it was in New Orleans that Lincoln saw slavery in the mass—slavery that labored in the killing humidity and heat of the Louisiana cane fields, slavery that begat an exotic biracial class of mulattoes, slavery that turned every obsequious Sambo by day into a potential throat-slitter by night, slavery on the auction block, spread-legged and naked.

tribune

Jackson clearly saw himself as the tribune of the ‘‘the humble members of society’’—oppressed farmers, the unemployed artisans, and the old Jeffersonian enemies of expansive government. Jackson turned his presidency into a veto-machine of every bill that looked to provide federal support for manufacturing, internal improvements, roads and canals, the sale of public lands for financing internal improvements and banking. Henry Clay split from the old Jeffersonian coalition to form a new political party: Whig.
