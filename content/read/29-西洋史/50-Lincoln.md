Lincoln was, as his friend and admirer, David Davis, once said, ‘‘the most reticent—Secretive man I Ever Saw—or Expect to See.’’ His law partner of fourteen years, William Henry Herndon, agreed: ‘‘the man was hard, very difficult to understand, even by his bosom friends and his close and intimate neighbors among whom he associated.’’

Lincoln’s intellectual curiosity frequently overspilled even the professional requirements of lawyering. John Todd Stuart told a campaign biographer in 1860 that Lincoln had a ‘‘mind of a metaphysical and philosophical order—His knowledge of the languages is limited but in other respects I consider a man of very general and varied knowledge.’’
