 I understand the attraction of a stereo mic for ease of use, but most stereo mics (except the expensive ones) lock you into one angle / spacing which may sound fabulous in some circumstances and mediocre to awful in others. One size does not fit all situations, and what will give you a great recording in a good concert hall may not be a good choice for at home and vice versa.

For instance, my favorite piano recordings by far are made with spaced omnis. I'm talking about a concert grand on full stick in a great hall where you want to capture the acoustic space properly as well as render the full tonal range of the instrument. But try that in a typical small home practice studio such as what I have, and you will likely end up with an awful recording swamped by an overabundance of early reflections.

Conversely, X/Y cardioids (such as what you get on cheap stereo mics) sound terribly narrow and flat in pretty much any classical concert recording situation. But in the small home studio situation where you want to minimize the sound of the too-small room in your recording, you can set your X/Y array quite close and get a pretty decent recording.

Now, if you get a pair of separate mics, that gives you the ability to alter the angle and spacing to your heart's content, dialing in the amount of acoustic you want (or do not) want to capture. No stereo mic will ever give you that level of flexibility. If you don't know all of the arrangements or what adjusting angles and spacing actually does, hang around here and you'll learn a lot about those things. Once you learn more about this, you'll quickly wish you had bought separate mics.

The best thing for home recording of a piano in this situation is probably a spaced pair of good figure-8 mics which will have deep nulls to cancel the ceiling and sidewall reflections in a home studio. Then when you are in a nice concert hall, you can align them together for a mid-side Blumlein recording and be able to manipulate the stereo image and direct / diffuse ratio in post. That's the closest thing to an all-purpose mic setup that would work for you, but it's also going to be the most expensive. A pair of Sennheiser MKH 30 is on my to-buy list when I have a spare $2500...

Sorry this turned into such a long post. Here's the TL:DR: The Superlux S502 will probably sound great in a concert situation as long as it's properly placed and you're in a good hall. But it will probably *not* sound great in your home, since it's going to grab too many early reflections from very close walls and ceilings.

>
> Answer: Basically, AF capacitor microphones use the capsule as a capacitor to store charge. With one fixed plate and the other free to vibrate in sympathy with the sound, the capacitance varies, and the charge moves in or out of the capsule accordingly. This is measured by the head preamplifier and an audio signal results. All well and good, but the capsule is inherently in a high impedance circuit --- it has to sit there with stored
> charge until the diaphragm moves and any changes in the charge are perceived as audio. In a humid atmosphere the stored charge finds it easier to escape on water molecules in the air rather than through the input of the preamplifier, hence noisy and reduced output, and misery all round. 
>
> The RF system (as used in Sennheiser MKH microphones) uses the capsule as a tuning capacitor for an RF oscillator -- which inherently employs it in a low impedance circuit where a high frequency signal is being passed through the capacitor all the time. Changes in capacitance (caused by sound moving the diaphragm) alter the resonant frequency of the circuit (circa 8MHz) and so its frequency becomes proportional to the
> audio signal. A simple RF demodulator restores the output to a conventional audio signal. More complex and slightly more fragile (the basic frequency is determined by a crystal), this system is highly immune to the effects of humidity and is thus the preferred design to be used out of doors (or when moving from outside to inside on a cold day!).

[LEGENDARY NATURE RECORDIST GORDON HEMPTON ON HIS QUEST TO CAPTURE A QUIET PLANET](https://www.asoundeffect.com/quiet-planet-gordon-hempton/)，March 18, 2020 by Jennifer Walden 

<img src="https://cdna.asoundeffect.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/17131546/Quiet_Planet_Gordon_Hempton.jpg" width="700">

Years ago, there were tourism posters for the US Virgin Islands lining the insides of the NYC subway cars. I remember zoning out while staring at them on my commute home, trading the screech and clatter of the train for the tickle of wind across an empty beach and the gentle hissing of broken waves snaking up the warm sand. It was a soothing daydream.

In our daily bustle and grind, it’s easy to take for granted the quiet solace of nature. We know it’s out there, somewhere, that promise of calming waves and wind. Or, maybe you prefer a chorus of birds and insects.

Here’s the bad news — quiet is disappearing at an alarming rate. Noise pollution has inundated even locations that are so remote you can walk for 1,200 miles in one direction before coming to a road, according to Gordon Hempton — Emmy award-winning nature sound recordist/acoustic ecologist/co-founder of Quiet Parks International.

That place Hempton is referring to belongs to the Cofan Nation of Ecuador’s Amazon rainforest, which Hempton has visited on numerous field recording trips for his Quiet Planet series — a growing library of nature recordings that is Hempton’s life’s work. It spans decades and covers the planet’s quietest places, from deserts to rainforests. It’s like a lexicon of Earth’s language. And to help sound designers understand it, Hempton wrote a companion piece, a book called Earth is a Solar Powered Jukebox.

If you’re interested in joining Hempton on a field recording trip to Ecuador’s Amazon rainforest, you can sign up through Explorer X .

Hempton’s search for quiet spaces in nature went from being a passion to a preservation mission. He co-authored a book with John Grossmann called One Square Inch of Silence that documents Hempton’s trek across the US, recording sounds and data in preparation for a meeting with federal officials to request protection for natural soundscapes against noise pollution.

Hempton and Vikram Chauhan are co-founders of Quiet Parks International, which, according to their site quietparks.org, is a nonprofit organization that is creating a set of classifications, standards, testing methods, and management guidelines for the certification of the world’s pristine and endangered quiet places. Quiet Parks International has established the world’s first Wilderness Quiet Park and developed a list of over 262 potential sites around the globe that should be certified and preserved.

Here, Hempton talks about his strategies for capturing natural ambiences, shares stories from his recording trips around the globe, gives tips on minimizing your physical and acoustical impact on nature, and discusses the importance of quiet and how you can help to preserve it.

Not many people visit the Amazon rainforest, but you’ve been there numerous times. What’s it like?

Gordon Hempton (GH): I go down there at least twice a year, and I’m heading down there now. This time though, it’s during the summer. The first time I went down there in June, to the Ecuadorian Amazon, I was sweltering. I had a bug net on. It was torturous. So I asked my guide, “When’s the good time to come?” and he thinks about it and then answers, “This is it!”

June is in their winter, so it’s “cooler” and “less buggy” then it will be when I go down now (in March). I’ll be taking my assistant with me. It’s exciting and adventurous because we’re going to a new region of the Amazon, called the “Lakes Region.” That seems to be the literal translation of the place name. So I asked my guides if there will be alligators down there, and they said, “Yeah, well, that’s where it gets its name from.”

Quiet_Planet_sound-3
It’s a canoe, not a boat.

We plan on doing a lot of sound recording from the boat and so we’re not going to use the “small boat” this time because it’s too easy for the alligators to get in. The small boat is really small. It’s practically a large coconut shell. It’s amazing that you can get in there and paddle. The Cofan paddle from the front of the canoe, not the back. So, yeah, it’s a large canoe but it’s not a boat. We are going to stay awake and alert I’m sure.

Quiet_Planet_sound-17

One thing I’ve learned long ago is to stay right behind your guide, never in front. And where ever my guide steps, my foot is going to go into their footprint. They are making little decisions that I can’t see. My work essentially takes me to places where people are not. And when I get there, I find out why people aren’t there. That’s because something there is going to kill you. Unless, of course, you stay awake; stay alert and do what your guide does.

Quiet_Planet_sound-6
Where ever my guide steps, my foot is going to go into their footprint.

The guide, by the way, thinks that what they know is common sense. But in reality, even their little kids know better than I know. The guide doesn’t know how little I know. Also, when we have a limited vocabulary, I might interpret them wrong. So that’s why I want to do exactly what the guide does.

For instance, my last trip to the Amazon was in June 2019. I was there with another fellow from the Bay Area. Our two guides — whom we didn’t understand at all — were leading us in to the jungle to drop us off in two different places. They were going to leave us alone so we could camp all by ourselves in the jungle. That’s not a bad thing for me, because I know that if there is any noise pollution then I’ll be responsible. All I have to do is be quiet and I know I’m going to nail some fantastic sounds for Quiet Planet. On our way in, the guides stop. So we stop. We’re all being quiet. The guides look at each other and start giving hand signals. I’m looking at them, like, “What does that mean?”

They start sniffing the air in an exaggerated way, to get us to sniff the air too. I’m not smelling what they smell because their senses are not compromised by Western living.

So they indicate there’s a sound coming from one direction. Then they point to the ground and show the hoof marks of wild boar. And they show there are a lot of wild boar.

So for some reason, I claim to be an expert at interpreting sign language and gestures. So I turn to Sam, the fellow I was traveling with, and say, “They say there are wild boar that way. 45 of them.” And I believe it myself. Like, I know they just said 45 to me.

I tell Sam, “Whatever happens, we stay with them. Because without them, we’re lost.”

Then, the guides take off. They run into the jungle and so we run after one of the guys. And he’s going fast. Really fast. Right into a herd of wild boar, with tusks, and there are more than a hundred of them.

Sam and I can’t believe we’re in this situation, like, “What are we doing here?!?!”

Then the guns go off. And the boar stampede. And we’re all set to jump up a tree.

Quiet_Planet_sound-12

As soon as the guns went off, it was over. The whole hunt lasted five seconds. It happened so fast there wasn’t even time to pick a tree. But, we survived.

So now I’m thinking our guides are lost. We saw them throw down their machetes and we’re in this thick jungle. Plus, they need their machetes to cut up the three wild boar they shot because the boar are as big as they are.

But no. The guide reaches down and grabs this wild boar and puts it in a fireman’s carry. This boar is equal to his own weight. He holds it with one hand and balances it on his shoulders. The boar, meanwhile, is dripping its entrails down the Cofan’s back. The guy is feeling really comfortable; he’s a successful hunter. He walks through the jungle — and again, we follow him with our footsteps going into his footsteps — and he walks right to his machete, picks it up, and walks right back to “the path.” By the way, we can’t even see this path. They see it though.

Quiet_Planet_sound-14
By the way, we can’t even see this path. They see it though.

So they drop these three wild boar down and we continue on for another hour or so. Sam goes off with one guide and I walk with the other guide for another hour. We construct a shelter from jungle palms. And then the guide leaves me. As he’s leaving, I say, “Thank you. Have a good night. Hope you stay safe.” And so he gives me what I think is the Cofan equivalent of “goodnight.” He hands me the machete with both hands and says, “muy peligro.”

I think, boy these Cofan can really be serious when they say goodnight and pleasant dreams.

Fast forward to later when I get back to the village and ask the chief’s son what “muy peligro” means. He says, “Very dangerous.”

I slept well that night in the jungle though, after that boar hunt. I ended up drinking a full gallon of water and eating all the food meant to last a day and a half, and then I lay down and, for all purposes, just died in the rain forest. Any animal could have had their way with me. But, I woke up in the morning. I grabbed my recording gear and then used my own sense of hearing (which, by the way, is pretty impaired and that’s why I work with assistants) to find where to set up the microphones. I hit record and just let it roll.

Quiet_Planet_sound-11

I know for other field recordists out there, that situation is a dream come true. During the entire morning period there were absolutely no noise intrusions. It’s nature at its wildest for sure.

I’m seriously considering starting to assist the Cofan in Ecuador by leading field recording workshops down into the Amazon once or twice a year. I don’t get paid a dollar to do this. In fact, I pay for my own meals and transportation. This is entirely to benefit the Cofan (the indigenous tribe that hosts us). They are interested in not only sharing their wonderful nation but they also would like to use the money they earn from these workshops to pay the legal fees to defend their lands against foreign corporations that seek to take their oil, their gold, their wildlife, and their timber despite their unwillingness to sign any legal agreements to allow that.

Quiet_Planet_sound-9
A field recording trip to the Amazon

The Cofan today only number 1,200 individuals, up from 300 people. Their original population was 30,000. The Cofan just turned down a contract from an oil company that would allow all 1,200 Cofan living there to never work another day in their life. They turned down that contract because they knew that if they accepted it then they would cease to be people of the forest. They would cease to be who they truly know they are. They’ve made their stand and they said, “No.” But the companies are coming in any way. This is a fossil fuel-hungry world. And they live in a nation of laws that are somewhat corrupt. They need our assistance. You don’t even need to attend the field recording workshops I am planning on repeating every year. You can simply go to Cofan.org and make a contribution.
