事件：高考語文開考之前，地點：N大三附中考點。聲音最好的一點是你沒法直接判斷出時閒，所以我就按邏輯順序剪出來，很多都是打亂了時閒先後的。

Event: before the college entrance examination (Chinese). Location: the third affiliated secondary school. The best thing about sound is that you can't judge the time order, so I cut it out in a logical order, and many of them are disrupted. 

## 內容提要

從呼朋引伴，老師招呼學生，到看考點，複習，到家長、老師最後的叮囑、加油，到進考場，確定幾箇遲到的學生是否來了，最後是老師、家長的閑聊。

Greeting, seeing the test sites, reviewing, the parents' and teacher's last exhorting, and finally the chat between the teacher and the parents.
