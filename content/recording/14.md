## 故事

疫情期間半封校，外面的人不能進學校，於是大家拿外賣都得去大門，隔著大鐵門遞。小的可以從下面穿過去，大的快遞就要從上面扔。這下學校裏一下沒了穿來穿去的電瓶車，跟我剛上大學時一樣。但看起來，外賣員的工作似乎並沒有減輕多少，興許他們自己騎車送到樓下，還比學生慢騰騰走到大門口來得快。

外賣快遞都有，肯德基麥當勞CoCo一點點美團宅急送百事順豐天天極兔申通全都齊活。一箇小細節：念編號，比如 131，一般同學都是「一三一」，不過快遞員都念成「一百三十一」，可能是爲了清楚？快遞員著實不容易，一箇大叔送了八次，最後還是得罵著放門邊。一箇小哥腳腫了，還是得送。

說一下剪輯。這是頭一次用三聲道錄音，兩箇全指向的用作左右聲道，短槍用作中間聲道，對準想要突出的主體。還是像原來那樣，第一遍粗處理好之後放到多軌編輯器，然後不斷調整。最後輸出的時候發現無論怎麼辦，都只能輸出雙聲道。這可不完蛋。思來想去，最後推倒重來，先把源文件三箇聲道各自分離出來，再把所有文件的同一聲道拖到多軌編輯器，一箇聲道用一條軌道。剪輯的時候三條軌道同時選中來調整。然後三條軌道分別合并剪輯，在源文件中調整細節，處理雜音。最後調整各軌道比重，合并爲兩聲道。

During the epidemic, the university is half closed and people outside are not allowed to enter the campus. So everyone has to go to the gate to get their takeaway through the big iron gate. The small one can be passed through from below, and the large one must be thrown from above. There is no electric bicycle running through the campus, just like when I first went to college. But it seems that the work of couriers hasn't been reduced much. Maybe it's faster for them to ride inside than the students walk slowly to the gate.

There are takeaway and express delivery. KFC, McDonald's, CoCo, Yidiandian, Meituan, Home Delivery, Baishi, SF, Tiantian, jitu, Shentong…Everything's here. One small detail: When reciting the serial number, such as 131, most students say "one three one", but the couriers say "one hundred and thirty-one". Maybe it is for clarity? The couriers are really hard. An uncle delivered it eight times, and finally had to curse and leave it by the door. Another courier had swollen feet and still had to deliver it.

Talk about editing. This is my first three-channel recording. Two omni microphones are set as the left and right channels, and the short gun is used as the middle channel, aiming at the subject that you want to highlight. Still as before, after the first rough processing, put it into the multitrack editor, and then keep adjusting. In the final output, I found that no matter what to do, it can only output two channels. It's terrible. It means the third channel has no use. After thinking for a while, I overturn it and restart. Firstly, I separated the three channels of the source files, and then dragged the same channel of all files to the multi-track editor, occupying one track for each channel. When editing, three tracks are selected simultaneously. Then merge each track and edited separately to adjust details and deal with noise. Finally merge into two channels.
